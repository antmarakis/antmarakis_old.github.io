*Effective Python, 59 Ways to Write Better Python* by Brett Slatkin is a neat little book to help you hone your Python skills (both for 2 and 3). It consists of tips across various concepts, from useful built-in modules to documentation. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn some cool stuff to do with Python.
