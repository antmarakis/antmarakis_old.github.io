title: The Mystical Yield Keyword - A Bit of Info
category: Bits of Info
---

If you have played around in C# enough, you will have come across this mystifying keyword, 'yield'. Here I will try to explain in a nutshell what it does.

Say that you have a function like this:

<pre>
void SomeFunction(){
    //code A...

    yield return something;

    //code B...
}
</pre>

To understand what yield does, I will run you through the execution of the function. First, code A is executed. Then, <i>SomeFunction</i> is <b>paused</b> until <i>something</i> iterates over the next value. If <i>something</i> is a list, it will move to the next item and execution of <i>SomeFunction</i> will resume. If <i>something</i> is a function, it will get executed and when it finishes, <i>SomeFunction</i> will resume.

In a nutshell, this is how 'yield' works.
