<i>Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</i>, by Philip Jackson Jr.

I want to start by saying this is an old book and most of the information is outdated. Only read this to get a feel of the earlier research and thought process on the topic of Artificial Intelligence.

If you pick up this book to have an interesting read and a historic glimpse on past research, you will enjoy this greatly. It is a nicely written book, with examples, illustrations and easy wording to get the concepts across.

The first half in particular gives a very insightful and interesting overview of research on the field. The other half stalls a bit, getting more technical and delving deeper into concepts that are unfortunately outdated.

If you can get past that, you are in for a relaxed and interesting read. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in AI wanting to take a peek at previous work.
